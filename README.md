## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt some new tricks using position and z-index.


```css
.hover-image {
    position: absolute;
    top: 40%;
    right: 41%;
    z-index: 1;
}
```


### Continued development

1. CSS Position and Z-index
2. Grid and Flexbox


### Useful resources

- [Tutorial Republic](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/faq/how-to-change-image-on-hover-with-css.php) - This helped me for the image and overlay.
